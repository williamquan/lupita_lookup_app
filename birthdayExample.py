import json

#
# this is a relative path to the .json data file
# you can also use a "full" or "absolute path" to the file
# windows and mac paths are different.  You should google and youttube to learn about paths if you are
# not familiar with them.  They are important fundamental computer concepts.
#
# this is a full windows path, note the forward slashes "/" used in python
# pathToFile = "E:/Users/jerome/GitHub/evc-cit134a-python/birthday/birthday.json"
#
# mac (which is built on linux) and linux paths are like this: "a/b/c/d/e/f.json"
